## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt howw to use the css flexbox. I used thr flex-direction property to change the page layout on mobile and desktop.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
```
```css
.d_flex{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```
.d_flex{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}
```js
```

### Continued development

I will focus on javascript and css grid in the future.
